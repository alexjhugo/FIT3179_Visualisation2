                    <h2>Number of Medals by Countries/Teams</h2>
                    <p>The map on the right shows us the number of medals by countries, using the circle areas drawn over the countries geographical area.
                        We can observe that the United States of America is the country that obtained the highest number of medals. We can also see that there are quite a lot of European countries that obtained medals. Africa, on the other hand, is the opposite. It has a lot of countries within it (54 countries), but only a handful of them obtained medals (11 countries). Kenya is the best performing African country in terms of the overall medal count. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Asia also has quite a lot of countries that obtained medals, with a few of them contributing a considerable amount. The People's Republic of China is the second best performing country in the world in terms of their overall medal count, sitting just behind the United States of America. In fact, combining the Chinese countries into a single country (People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and Chinese Taipei), will give us a country with the highest number of gold medals. Japan, the host country, also obtained a significant amount, at 58 total medals and 27 gold medals.
