                    The <b>Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics</b> is an international sports event that was long awaited by many
                    countries,
                    since the last summer olympic games in Brazil, 2016. It was the fourth olympic games to be held
                    in <b>Japan</b>,
                    set in their capital city of <b>Tokyo</b>. It was also unfortunately <b>delayed by a year</b> due to
                    the emergence
                    of the <b>COVID-19 Pandemic</b> that caused mass lockdowns around the world.
                    However, the games eventually took place and through this visualisation, we'll discuss about some
                    of the event's key highlights.

                    <h2>American Victory</h1>
                        <p>
                            The <b>United States of America (US)</b> is the top performing country
                            in terms of the overall total number of medals. It has acquired a total
                            of <b>113</b> medals. It is consequently the top 
                            country in terms of the medal count in the <b>North American</b> region, beating
                            its neighbours, <b>Canada</b> and <b>Mexico</b>, by a large margin. In addition, it had also 
                            surpassed its rival superpower, <b>China</b>, in the overall number of medals. However,
                            <b>China</b> is actually not far behind the US for the other medal categories and performance.
                            This is shown through the other visualisations below.

                    <p>
                        <b>Europe</b> is the best region in terms of the overall medal count. It has a lot of
                        countries within it that obtained medals, and a significant portion of them are
                        strong performers. These include a number of <b>Western European</b> countries
                        such as <b>Great Britain</b> and <b>Germany</b>. To the East, we have <b>Russia</b> 
                        (represented by the <b>Russian Olympic Committee</b>), acquiring a total of 71 medals which is
                        a significant portion of <b>Europe's</b> overall medal count. 
                        This places <b>Europe</b> as the top region in the world, in terms of the overall medal count.

                        The heatmap on the left shows the distribution of the medal types of the top ten performing
                        countries. Through it, we can see that <b>China</b> and the <b>US</b> performed similarly in
                        terms of their <b>Gold</b> medal count. We can also see that four <b>Western European</b>
                        countries: the <b>Netherlands</b>, <b>France</b>, <b>Germany</b>, and <b>Italy</b>, performed 
                        similarly with one another in terms of <b>Gold</b> and <b>Silver</b> medals. As for the <b>Bronze</b>
                        medals, they each performed somewhat differently with one another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar pattern again applies to <b>Great Britain</b> and <b>Russia</b>. The two Countries
                        obtained a similar amount of medals for the <b>Gold</b> and <b>Bronze</b> categories. The main
                        factor
                        differentiating the two is that <b>Russia</b> had won quite a higher amount of <b>Silver</b>
                        medals
                        than <b>Great Britain</b>. Despite their impressive performance, the two still got outclassed by
                        <b>Japan</b> in terms of the <b>Gold</b> medal count. It seems that being the host country really
                        has really boosted their athletes' morales, doesn't it?

                        <p>
                            As mentioned previously, the <b>US</b> had beaten <b>China</b> in terms 
                            of the total medal count. However, they actually performed similarly in terms
                            of the <b>gold</b> medals obtained, as shown from our heatmap above. 
                            In fact, <b>China</b> is actually performing better than the <b>US</b> when we
                            look at their <b>athletes to gold medal ratio</b>. <b>China</b> has about
                            <b>11 athletes</b> for every <b>gold</b> medal obtained, while the <b>US</b> has roughly
                            <b>16 athletes</b> for every <b>gold</b> medal it won.

                    <p>
                        <b>Kosovo</b> is a state located in the Balkans, at <b>Southern Europe.</b>
                        It has a small landmass and is landlocked by several countries. However,
                        it performed very impressively in terms of the <b>athlete to gold medal ratio</b>.
                        It obtained a ratio of <b>5 athletes</b> for every <b>gold</b> medals won,
                        despite only sending a few athletes to the games. <b>Kosovo</b> had proven to us
                        that bigger countries don't necessarily outperform small countries, if we compare them
                        using this ratio.

                        Through the bar chart on the right, it is evident that the majority
                        of the sport discipline are dominated mostly by <b>male</b> athletes.
                        This is especially true for disciplines such as <b>Athletics</b>, <b>Swimming</b>,
                        and <b>Football</b>. Despite that, the number of <b>male</b> athletes is not significantly
                        larger than the number of <b>female</b> athletes for most of the sport disciplines. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        In fact, some of the sport disciplines are
                        exclusively <b>female</b> only. These include <b>Artistic Swimming</b> and <b>Rhythmic Gymnastics.</b>
                        They are both a sport discipline that is by tradition, only meant for <b>female</b> athletes. Thus, no
                        <b>male</b> athletes are allowed to participate in them, which is reflected by our chart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the sport disciplines, we can tell that <b>Athlethics</b> is the most participated one 
                        because it has the highest number of athletes for both genders. On the other hand, 
                        <b>Trampoline Gymnastics</b> has the least amount of athletes of both genders amongst the sport
                        disciplines shown in the bar chart. It is also the least participated <b>gymnastic</b> sport discipline, 
                        when comparing to <b>Artistic Gymnastics</b> and <b>Rhythmic Gymnastics</b>.
