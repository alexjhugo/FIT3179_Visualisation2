                    <h2>Number of Medals by Countries</h2>
                    <p>The map on the right shows us the number of medals by countries, using the circle areas drawn over the countries geographical area.
                        We can observe that the United States of America is the country that obtained the highest number of medals.
                        We can also see that there are quite a lot of European countries that obtained medals. Africa, on the other hand, is the opposite. 
                        It has a lot of countries within it, but only a handful of them obtained medals. 
                        Kenya is the best performing African country in terms of the overall medal count. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Asia also has quite a lot of countries that obtained medals, with a few of them contributing a considerable amount. 
                        The People's Republic of China is the second best performing country in the world in terms of their overall medal count,
                        sitting just behind the United States of America. Japan, the host country, also obtained a significant amount. 
                        It's ranked the 3rd in the world in terms of its Gold medal count, and it acquired a total of 58 medals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sitting just below Asia, we have two strong performing countries in the Oceania region. Australia has managed to obtained a considerable amount of medals,
                        at 46 total medals. New Zealand, despite being a relatively small country in terms of geographical area, also did relatively well, at a total of 20 medals.
                    </p>
                    <p> What's even more interesting here is the fact that 
                        countries with a large land area, do not necessarily have more medals than smaller countries. Russia (represented by the Russian Olympic Committee) 
                        and Canada, for example, have less medals than countries such as the United States of America and China. In fact, Japan outperformed
                        Russia in terms of their Gold medal count, which is further illustrated in the heatmap below.

                        The United States of America is yet again the highest performing country, this time in terms of all three categories of medal types.
                        It obtained the highest amount of Gold medals from all the countries in the world. However, this is just one medal above the amount obtained by the People's Republic of China.
                        Japan, as mentioned before, is also a rather interesting case. Despite being geographically small in terms of land area, it still managed to acquire the third highest amount
                        of Gold medals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another interesting pattern that we can see in the heatmap is that four of the European countries: 
                        the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy, all perform relatively similar to one another. They all obtained the same amount of Gold medals, and also a similar amount of silver medals.
                        What differs them is their bronze medal count, with Italy obtaining a considerably higher amount than the other three countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a whole, the top ten performing countries are mostly countries that are ranked highly in terms of their economy. 
                        This includes the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, and Japan, which were all also the top three countries economy wise.

                    <h2>Sports Discipline Athlete Gender Distribution</h2>
                    <p>The majority of the sport disciplines are dominated by a higher number of male athletes.
                        This is especially true for disciplines such as Athletics, Swimming, and Football, as they 
                        all have a relatively higher number of male athletes than female ones. 
                        Despite that, the number of male and female athletes for the majority of the 
                        sport disciplines are roughly equal, with the number male athletes being a tad higher in most cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, certain sport disciplines such as Artistic Swimming and Rhythmic Gymnastics only
                        have female athletes participating. It is such the case as these two sport disciplines are exclusively female only,
                        hence the absence of male athletes. There is also no sport disciplines that are male-only in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.
